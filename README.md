# 📚 Library Management System (LMS) - SQL Project 📊

Welcome to the **Library Management System (LMS)** project! 🎓 This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional library management system using **SQL**. The goal is to manage library operations like **book records**, **user management**, **borrow/return transactions**, and more using SQL queries and database design techniques.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is designed to handle day-to-day library tasks with ease by managing:

- 📚 **Books and Resources**: Adding, updating, and deleting book records.
- 👨‍🎓 **Students/Members**: Registering new users and managing membership details.
- 🔄 **Transactions**: Borrowing and returning books, tracking due dates.
- 📊 **Reports**: Generating summaries of overdue books, user activity, and stock availability.

This project provides an efficient way of organizing and retrieving library data using **SQL** as the database backbone.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SQL**: The core technology used to create tables, relationships, and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Database Management System**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible DBMS.
- **ER Diagram**: Visual representation of the database structure to demonstrate relationships between entities.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 📚 **Book Management**: Add, remove, and update book records, including details like author, ISBN, genre, and stock availability.
- 👥 **Member Management**: Register new members, update their details, and manage their borrowing activity.
- 🔄 **Transaction System**: Issue and return books with automatic due date and fine calculation.
- 🕒 **Overdue Tracking**: Query overdue books and notify users for returns.
- 📊 **Reports**: Generate reports for library statistics, such as the most borrowed books and member activity logs.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utkarsh2387/Library_Management_system_SQL.git
   ```
2. **Run the SQL scripts** in your preferred SQL environment:
   - `create_tables.sql`: Creates the necessary tables for the LMS.
   - `insert_data.sql`: Populates the tables with sample data.
   - `queries.sql`: Contains useful queries for various library operations.
3. **Execute Queries**: Use the provided SQL queries to interact with the system, such as adding new books, managing members, and processing book loans.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- 🖥️ **Front-End Integration**: Build a simple UI to interact with the SQL database.
- 🔄 **Advanced Search**: Implement advanced search options with filters for genres, authors, or publication dates.
- 📦 **Backup/Restore System**: Add functionality to back up and restore the database.
- 💻 **Cloud Database**: Deploy the system using a cloud-hosted database service like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL.
